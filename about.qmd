I’ve always loved maths and science, I meant to be a Veterinary, I wanted to do ballet classes, teach gymnastic, be an economist, a psychologist… Many years passed since I started the journey of my career as an investigator, it turned out to be an everyday challenge with tasks to solve, and most importantly a continuous learning path.
