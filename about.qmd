Iâ€™ve always loved maths and science, I meant to be a Veterinary, I wanted to do ballet classes, teach gymnastic, be an economist, a psychologistâ€¦ Many years passed since I started the journey of my career as an investigator, it turned out to be an everyday challenge with tasks to solve, and most importantly a continuous learning path. Each day brings with it a fresh set of challenges to solve and opportunities for growth. It's a path marked by curiosity, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of excellenceâ€”a journey that I'm grateful to be on.

### Health Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases: Machine Learning Applications and Spatial Modelling Analysis with R

ðŸ”— <https://bookdown.org/fede_gazzelloni/hmsidR/>

##### Editor CRC Press - Chapman & Hall

\

Discover the fascinating world of health metrics and infectious disease analysis with our upcoming manual and textbook! Whether you're new to the field or a seasoned practitioner, this resource offers valuable insights into key concepts and practical applications.

Learn about essential public health metrics like **DALYs**, **YLL**, and **YLD**, which provide crucial indicators of a population's health status. Dive into recent infectious disease outbreaks, including the impact of Covid19, and explore the most affected locations.

With a mix of explanatory text and hands-on R code examples, you'll become proficient in analyzing real-world case studies. We'll compare health metrics across different locations and test predictive models using `tidymodels` and `INLA.` Plus, you'll discover the power of spatial visualization techniques using `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, `sf`, `rgdal`, and other popular R packages. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced practitioner, this book is designed to enhance your understanding and skills in health data analysis.

Ideal for early-stage practitioners and graduate students in public health, this resource is your guide to unlocking the full potential of R for spatial and health metrics analysis.
