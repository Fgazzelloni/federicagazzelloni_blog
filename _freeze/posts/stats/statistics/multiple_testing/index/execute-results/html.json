Under this specification, simple questions to be answered would be:\n\n-   to be a female can be more or less risky in incurring heart disease?\n\n-   or, what is the age on average at which heart diseases start increasing?\n\nTo answer these questions we need to make some assumptions:\n\nthere is no gender difference in heart diseases increasing age is not a cause of heart diseases\n\n# Hypothesis testing\n\nThe first hypothesis is namely, the **null hypothesis** $H_{0}$, and in general, it assumes that there would be no difference in mean (expected value) between the levels of the predictors. In case the null hypothesis fails, an alternative hypothesis is considered, such as there is a difference.\n\n1.  Null hypothesis $H_{0}$: the difference in mean equals zero\n2.  Alternative hypothesis $H_{a}$: the difference in mean is not zero\n\nThis is the starting point of making a hypothesis testing, then more variables can be tested, excluded, or kept whether there is a difference in the mean or not. And, so we are talking of multiple testing of hypothesis.\n\n## Steps to hypothesis testing\n\n1.  Define the null and alternative hypothesis\n2.  Construct a test statistic against the null hypothesis\n3.  Compute a p-value to quantify the probability to obtain a value that is the same or more extreme than the test statistic under the null hypothesis\n4.  Decide whether to reject the null hypothesis\n\n## Step back to modeling\n\nLet's hypothesize that we are investigating the root cause of heart diseases. To be simplistic we hypothesize that only gender and age are the key drivers for high blood pressure, the cause of the disease.\n\nHow would you make a model for answering this question?\n\nAs an example, we use the **heart_disease** dataset from the {cheese} package, and to begin our investigation we consider two predictors **Age** and **Sex**.\n\n**Model function**: $y=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\beta_{2}x_{2}\\epsilon$\n\n**Hypothesis**:\n\n1.  $\\beta_{i}$ equals to zero\n2.  there is no difference between the mean blood pressure in female and male groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(cheese)\nheart_disease %>%head\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_disease%>%\n  ggplot(aes(y=HeartDisease,fill=factor(Sex)),color=\"white\") +\n  geom_histogram(stat=\"count\",position = \"dodge\")+\n  labs(fill=\"Sex\")+\n  scale_fill_brewer()+\n  theme_test()\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo be continued...\n\n</details>\n\n### Resources:\n\n-   [HeartDisease](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cheese/vignettes/cheese.html) dataset\n-   [Multiple Testing - Washington](https://www.gs.washington.edu/academics/courses/akey/56008/lecture/lecture10.pdf)\n",
