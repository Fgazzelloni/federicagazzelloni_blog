### ShinyConf2024 - Shiny4Good Talk

**Date**: April 2024

**Abstract**: This talk will offer insights gained from active participation in the **Data Science Learning Community** through participation in **Shiny book clubs**. By exploring the unique dynamics of these forums, I will highlight the collaborative and knowledge-sharing atmosphere that the Data Science Learning Community cultivates. The talk will draw examples from the book clubs to illustrate how practical discussions and exercises amplify the learning experience.
