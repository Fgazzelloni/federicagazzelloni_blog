Itâ€™s been an incredible journey, and while the book is nearing its completion, I feel a mix of emotionsâ€”both the excitement of sharing it with you and a touch of sadness that this creative process is coming to an end. ðŸ˜Œ

Writing this book has been an immensely rewarding experience. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours into selecting the right material, striving to present it in a way thatâ€™s accessible and helpful for early-career researchers and students. One of the biggest challenges was deciding what to include and what to leave out, constantly refining the content to ensure itâ€™s both comprehensive and easy to follow.

Even though the book is almost finished, my mind is still buzzing with ideas. Thereâ€™s always that lingering thought of what else could be added to make it even better. But at some point, you have to step back and trust that what youâ€™ve created will serve its purpose. And now, itâ€™s time to see how it will resonate with you, the readers.

As I reflect on this journey, Iâ€™m filled with gratitude for all the support and feedback Iâ€™ve received along the way. Your encouragement has been invaluable in shaping this book into what it is today.

So, whatâ€™s next? While this project may be wrapping up, my passion for writing and sharing knowledge is far from over. Stay tuned for more updates and future projects! In the meantime, I invite you to dive into the book, explore its content, and share your thoughts. Your insights will be crucial as I make final touches and consider potential additions.

Thank you for being a part of this journey. I hope the book serves as a valuable resource for your research and studies. Letâ€™s see where this new chapter takes us!
